    An object can have a superclass type and a subclass instance.
Polymorphic objects can only access the methods of their type, not of their instance, unless you use casting.
If a method is overwritten by the subclass, the polymorphic object will execute the overwritten method at runtime.
The instanceof operator is used to determine if an object is an instance of a certain class.
