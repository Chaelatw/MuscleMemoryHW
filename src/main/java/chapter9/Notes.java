    There are four major principles of object-oriented programming:

    encapsulation
    inheritance
    polymorphism
    abstraction

    Inheritance

Inheritance is where one class becomes an extension of another class, therefore inheriting the members of that class.
There are two parties involved in an inheritance â€” a parent and a child. The parent is known as the superclass, or sometimes also referred to as the parent class or base class. The child is known as the subclass, or sometimes referred to as the child class or the derived class.

When an inheritance relationship is created between these two classes, then the child class inherits the members of the parent class.

This allows classes to reuse data that already exists within other classes.

Subclasses should be a more specialized form of the superclass that they inherit from.
