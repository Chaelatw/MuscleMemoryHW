    /*
    Abstract classes and methods are templates that are meant to be implemented by their subclasses.

The classes and methods are declared abstract by using the abstract keyword.

If a subclass inherits from an abstract class, it must implement its abstract methods or the class itself must be declared as abstract.

Abstract classes cannot be instantiated. They are only to be used as a superclass. If even one method in a class is abstract, then the entire class must be declared abstract as well.

Interfaces cannot be instantiated.

Interfaces are implemented, not extended.

Any class that implements an interface must implement all of its methods or it must declare itself abstract.

Methods in an interface must be default or abstract (there's no explicit declaration needed for abstract methods)

Also notice that we didn't put an access modifier on the methods in an interface, either. That's because by default they're all public.
