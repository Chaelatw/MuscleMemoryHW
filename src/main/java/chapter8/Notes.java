    Dynamically typed programming languages determine the data type of a variable at runtime — meaning while the program is running. Therefore, in these types of languages the programmer doesn't need to specify the data type of a variable.

Java is a statically typed programming language — which means, it expects its variables to be declared before they can be assigned values because, in statically typed languages the data type is checked at compile time.

#Local Variable – Type Interference
While Java is a statically typed language, in version 10 of Java they added support for type inference — which means we can declare a variable as var and Java will infer the data type based on what is assigned to the variable.

Two-dimensional array =
    Rectangle[][] grid = getGridArray();
use the reserved word var as the data type.=
    var grid = getGridArray();

Rules for type reference
Type inference variables are only allowed for local variables. You cannot use var for declaring a global variable.

You must initialize these variables at the time of declaration, otherwise, the compiler is unable to infer what the data type should actually be.

Type inference is not allowed in the headers of methods or constructors. You must still explicitly declare the data type of parameters as well as the return types of methods.

All primitive data types can also be expressed as objects. These objects are known as wrapper classes.
